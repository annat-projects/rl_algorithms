# Reinforcement Learning algorithms
Implementation details for most common Reinforcement Learning algorithms from scratch:
* Deep Q-Network (DQN)
* Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
* Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
* PPO for Atari games
* PPO for continuous action spaces
* PPO with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
* PPO for MultiDiscrete action space
* PPO MultiDiscrete using Masked actions
* PPO Atari using Envpool
